## Summary of Contributions

*   **Code contributed:** [Link to tP Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2113-ay2526s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=limzerui&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2025-09-19T00%3A00%3A00&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&filteredFileName=&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=limzerui&tabRepo=AY2526S1-CS2113-T11-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

*   **Enhancements implemented:**
    *   **`add` Feature Implementation:**
        *   **Functionality:** Developed the core `add` command, enabling users to record expenses with amount (`a/AMOUNT`), description (`desc/DESCRIPTION`), and optional category (`cat/CATEGORY`), forming the backbone of data input.
        *   **Contributions:**
            *   `Parser.java`: Implemented `parseAddCommand` for interpreting user input and delegating argument extraction.
            *   `ArgumentParser.java`: Developed methods to robustly extract prefix-based arguments (`a/`, `desc/`, `cat/`).
            *   `InputValidator.java`: Created static methods (`validateAmount`, `validateDescription`, `validateCategory`) to ensure data integrity through validation.
            *   `AddCommand.java`: Implemented the `execute` method to encapsulate expense object creation and addition to `ExpenseManager`.
            *   `Expense.java`: Defined the expense structure (amount, description, category, paid status) and display formatting.
            *   `ExpenseManager.java`: Implemented `addExpense` to manage the collection of expenses.
            *   `Ui.java`: Contributed to displaying user feedback for new expenses (`showNewExpense`).
        *   **Testing:** Developed comprehensive test cases covering valid inputs, missing prefixes, and invalid data formats.

    *   **`bye` Feature Implementation:**
        *   **Functionality:** Did up the `bye` command for graceful application termination, ensuring data persistence and a clean exit.
        *   **Contributions:**
            *   `Parser.java`: Implemented `parseByeCommand` to handle command recognition and unexpected arguments.
            *   `ByeCommand.java`: Developed the `execute` method to orchestrate the farewell message display and signal application shutdown.
            *   `Ui.java`: Contributed `showGoodbye` for the farewell message and `showSeparator` for consistent formatting.
        *   **Testing:** Authored tests to validate the `bye` command's execution and proper exit signaling.

    *   **Testing Contributions (General):**
        *   Developed testing cases and code for core components including `Ui` (ensuring correct display of messages), `InputValidator` (comprehensive validation scenarios), `Parser` (correct command parsing), `InvalidCommandTest` (handling of invalid commands), `UnmarkCommandTest` (verifying unmarking logic), and `ArgumentParserTest`. 

*   **Contributions to the User Guide:**
    *   Wrote the documentation for the `add` and `bye` features, FAq and Command Summary sections.

*   **Contributions to the Developer Guide:**
    *   Set up the initial skeleton of the Developer Guide.
    *   Wrote the documentation for the `add`, `bye`, and `help` features, including their respective sequence diagrams.
    *   Wrote the full appendix, from Appendix A to Appendix E.

*   **Contributions to team-based tasks:**
    *   Provided skeleton code for the initial beginning of the project.
    *   Contributed to the design and creation of the skeleton and template for sequence diagrams used in the documentation.
    *   Maintained the issue tracker.

*   **Review/mentoring contributions:**
    *   Reviewed and mentored teammates on feature design and implementation, e.g. pull request [#54](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/54), where I provided feedback on command parsing and validation logic to ensure consistency with project conventions.
    *   Actively coordinated and supported the team during in-person meetings and Telegram discussions—clarifying requirements, unblocking tasks, and maintaining alignment on goals.

### Enhancements Implemented

#### 1. `edit` Feature
- **Functionality:** Allows modification of an expense’s amount, description, or category while preserving mark status. Automatically updates remaining balance and displays UI feedback.
- **Justification:** Enables data accuracy and flexibility without deleting and re-adding entries.
- **Main Contributions:**
  - `Parser.java`: Added `parseEditCommand()`.
  - `EditCommand.java`: Implemented `execute()` logic for editing and feedback.
  - `ExpenseManager.java`: Added `replaceExpense()`.
  - `Ui.java`: Added `showEditedExpense()` and `showEmptyEdit()`.

---

#### 2. `list` Feature
- **Functionality:** Displays all expenses with mark status, total budget, spent amount, and remaining balance.
- **Justification:** Provides a quick financial summary and reference for other commands (`edit`, `delete`, `mark`).
- **Details:** Automatically recalculates totals after updates.
- **Testing:** Verified outputs for empty, populated, and updated lists.

---

#### 3. `help` Feature
- **Functionality:** Shows all available commands and usage formats when `help` is entered.
- **Justification:** Reduces user errors and onboarding friction.
- **Main Contributions:**
  - `HelpCommand.java`: Implemented `execute()` calling `Ui.showMenu()`.
  - `Ui.java`: Added `showMenu()` for formatted command reference.

#### 4. Budget Alert
- **Functionality:** Displays alerts when balance nears or exceeds thresholds:
  - **NEAR:** < $10
  - **EQUAL:** = $0
  - **EXCEEDED:** < $0
- **Justification:** Promotes spending awareness and accountability.
- **Testing:** Validated all alert triggers.
